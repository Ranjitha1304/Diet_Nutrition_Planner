<h1>NUTRITION GUIDELINES</h1>
<h3> Protecting our independence</h3>
<h3> The Board of Trustees oversees the Foundation and ensures not only that the charity delivers against its 
    charitable aims but that it is impartial, transparent and acts with integrity.<br>
     As an independent organisation, a majority of the members of the Board of Trustees, Advisory Committee 
    and Scientific Committee may not have any personal financial interest in the commercial food industry. 
    Such members, who are drawn from diverse areas of public life (for example, from the academic scientific 
    community, education, health, communication, HR and finance) are known as the ‘independent trustees or 
    members’. Board decisions may be taken only when supported by a majority of the Foundation’s 
    independent trustees.</h3>
<h3>All Board and Committee members and members of the senior leadership team are required to sign a 
    declaration of interests which is updated annually. Declarations of interest are taken at every Board and 
    Committee meeting.</h3>
<h3> BNF’s reputation, credibility and charitable status depend upon the absolute impartiality of the 
    authoritative and evidence-based information it produces and disseminates. In every activity, BNF will 
    strive to ensure that we present best evidence and, wherever possible, the strength of this evidence will be 
    communicated to the target audience.<br>
     The Foundation’s journal Nutrition Bulletin is a peer-reviewed publication with an international Editorial 
    Advisory Board.</h3>
<h3> Our core purpose is to make nutrition science accessible, working with the public and with stakeholders in 
    academia, education, the food sector and others, to deliver content and programmes of work that engage 
    a range of audiences.</h3>
<h3>Our website is accredited by the Patient Information Forum ‘TICK’ scheme. This requires the health 
    information we provide to be evidence-based and referenced, where appropriate, and to be reviewed on a 
    regular cycle to ensure it is up to date. BNF will not accede to any pressure to publish or disseminate 
    information favourable to a particular sector, company, or product, nor will BNF suppress the publication 
    and dissemination of information because it is unfavourable to a particular company or sector.
     BNF will work with government agencies and industry to further its objects, but it is not a lobbying 
    organisation and will not take commercial or political pressures into account when publishing or 
    disseminating information. Our information, advice, educational materials and training are based on the 
    latest evidence base in nutrition science and in other relevant fields of scientific study.
     BNF seeks to maintain a broad funding base from a variety of sources. These include national or 
    international government departments and agencies; conferences, publications and training; membership 
    subscriptions; donations and project grants from food producers and manufacturers, retailers and food 
    service companies; grant providing bodies, trusts and other charities. The Foundation has procedures in 
    place to ensure transparency of funding.</h3>
<h3>  A list of corporate members is published on the BNF website and in our Annual Report. Applications for 
    corporate membership of the Foundation require the approval of the Board of Trustees. New members are 
    required to sign to indicate that they will abide by this ethical policy.
     BNF does not endorse any products or engage in food advertising campaigns. However, we recognise that 
    our brand has significant value and have put in place policies to protect our independence by restricting 
    the use of our name and logo. The BNF logo may not be applied to specific brands or products marketed 
    by any company or member who has provided funding or other benefit to the Foundation, nor will BNF 
    allow its logo to be used to confer an endorsement of specific products, brands or companies. In any 
    agreement signed with another organisation, BNF retains the right to approve any use of its name or its 
    logo.</h3>
<h3> Our Annual Report is published on the BNF website and submitted for publication to The Charity <br>
    Commission and to Companies House.<br>
     Our investment policy.</h3>
    <h3>The British Nutrition Foundation's Investment Policy is reviewed regularly by its Finance, Audit & Risk 
    Committee, chaired by the charity’s Treasurer. It states that:<br>
     “Although generally the interests of the Foundation are best served by seeking to obtain a sound financial 
    return from a suitably diverse portfolio of investments, the Investment Manager will have due regard to not 
    investing in those assets which could be detrimental to the objectives and aims of the Foundation. The 
    Foundation operates an ethical investment policy which is to avoid, where possible, investment in areas 
    contentious with the objects of the Foundation. The Trustees have agreed that this currently means 
    excluding direct investment in companies whose predominant activities are in gaming, tobacco, 
    pornography and armaments."</h3>
