        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <h3>Each new drug or surgical procedure is often heralded with great fanfare, letting you and your doctor know
            about the ways it is a game-changer or a life-saver. Corporate budgets drive their promotion and marketing
            campaigns, but what about advances in the field of nutrition? We don’t see ads on TV for broccoli for the
            same reason groundbreaking research on the power of foods and eating patterns to affect our health and
            longevity gets lost and buried in the medical literature. </h3>
        <h3>Put very simply: There is no profit-driven motive. Healthful eating and nutrition research may not make
            anyone money, but what if our lives would profit?</h3>
        <h3>Researchers have found a way of eating that may prevent, treat, and even reverse the progression of many
            of our deadliest diseases, including our number one killer, heart disease, as well as type 2 diabetes and
            high blood pressure. Despite this, doctors get little, if any, formal nutrition training in medical school
            and
            often graduate without some of the most powerful tools available to stop the chronic diseases that remain
            our leading causes of death and disability</h3>
        <h3>
            We believe that a significant part of the problem is that individuals who want to make the best dietary
            choices for themselves and their families are faced with a deluge of confusing and conflicting nutritional
            advice. Our goal is to present you and your doctor with the results of the latest in peer-reviewed nutrition
            and health research presented in a way that is easy to understand.</h3>
